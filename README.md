This is a social networking android application (called Chatroop), which was developed largely in 2019 and put it together in March 2020 for my practical school leaving exam.

The files weren't updated after March 2020. The app in not functional at the moment, because the servers are not running.

Basic information about the app and the entire creation process can be found in the attached pdf file.
